This week I finished brushing up details of the Todo App from the past two weeks and a half, and invited the Spark Staff and Mentors for a Demo presentation. Once again, practice beats theory.

# Demo Presentation

The past two weeks I implemented a web-based To Do App for a client that needed help in managing their daily tasks. I prepared a demo showcasing its features such as creating, editing, and deleting tasks, as well as pagination, searching, filtering and sorting tasks based on priority and due date, and a metrics area.

The demo was not just about showing the features. It was also an opportunity for me to reflect on the development process. I exposed some technical challenges that I had, missing features, learnings, and a nice QA session at the end of the presentation.

In terms of public speaking, practices beats theory (again). Even though I rehearsed the demo in my head many times I still stumbled over some of the details during the actual presentation. After the presentation I reflected in the gap between my spanish vs english presentation skills. There's still room for improvement, specifically in: tone, pace, body language, and interacting with the audience.

# Feedback Takeaways

I received feedback at the demo and in a shared document containing additional thoughts. It's interesting to note the contrast between my critical perception of my presentation versus the nothing but positive comments about it.

However, based on the feedback, I should pay closer attention to the finer details of my production code. For instance, I mistakenly left behind some residual console.log statements intended for debugging purposes and kept unused dependencies and imports. Moreover, I did not include guidelines on executing the code in the README documentation.
At this stage, I acknowledge that I must improve in how to structure and deliver code having in mind other coders that might read mine. Lastly, I only implemented the happy path of the project, and I omitted addressing error scenarios.

This feedback makes me reflect in a quote in the [_Manifesto for Software Craftmanship_](https://manifesto.softwarecraftsmanship.org/)

> Not only working software, \
> but also **well-crafted software**

In the future I plan to not overthink in addressing complex escenarios for possible optimizations, but rather into developing readable, maintanable, and robust code. I also plan to adquire more practice in my tools, in this case React + JS, and Java + Spring, implementing more "breakable toys", and finding scenarios of feedback of my more experienced peers.

# Final Remarks

The lesson I learned from this experience is to be more mindful of my approach and to focus on delivering a working solution rather than trying to do everything at once, _id est_ thinking ahead of time.

Overall, this week's demo presentation was a valuable learning experience and a closure for all the work from the past weeks. I look forward to applying these lessons to my future projects and presentations.
