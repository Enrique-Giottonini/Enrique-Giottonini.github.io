This week I finished brushing up details of the Todo App from the past two weeks and a half, and invited the Spark Staff and Mentors for a Demo presentation.

# Takeaways of the week

- Practice beats theory. Again.

# Demo Presentation

The past two weeks I implemented a web-based To Do App for a client that needed help in managing their daily tasks. I prepared a demo showcasing its features such as creating, editing, and deleting tasks, as well as pagination, searching, filtering and sorting tasks based on priority and due date, and a metrics area.

The demo was not just about showing the features. It was also an opportunity for me to reflect on the development process. I exposed some technical challenges that I had, missing features, learnings, and a nice QA session at the end of the presentation.

The lesson I learned from this experience is to be more mindful of my approach and to focus on delivering a working solution rather than trying to do everything at once, _id est_ thinking ahead of time.

And in terms of public speaking, practices beats theory (again). Even though I rehearsed the demo in my head many times I still stumbled over some of the details during the actual presentation. After the presentation I reflected in the gap between my spanish vs english presentation skills. There's still room for improvement, specifically in: tone, pace, body language, and interacting with the audience.

Overall, this week's demo presentation was a valuable learning experience and a closure for all the work from the past weeks. I look forward to applying these lessons to my future projects and presentations.
