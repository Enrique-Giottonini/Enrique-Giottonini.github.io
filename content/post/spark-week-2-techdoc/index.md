# FIVE LEETCODE SOLUTIONS

## OVERVIEW

I will present my solutions to five coding challenges assigned to my team during the second week of the Encora Spark Apprenticeship program. The problems are:

- [Median of Two Sorted Arrays](https://leetcode.com/problems/median-of-two-sorted-arrays/) HARD
  - [LRU Cache](https://leetcode.com/problems/lru-cache/) MID
  - [Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/) MID
  - [Regular Expression Matching](https://leetcode.com/problems/regular-expression-matching/) HARD
  - [Number of unequal triplets in aray](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-unequal-triplets-in-array/) EASY

For the "Medium" and "Hard" problems, we collaborated as a team, brainstorming together while one of us implemented the solution. The "Easy" problem was solved individually. I will describe each problem and its solution individually in this same blog.
